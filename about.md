### The *nix Philosophy

1. Small is beautiful.

2. Make each program do one thing well.

3. Build a prototype as soon as possible.

4. Choose portability over efficiency.

5. Store data in flat text files.

6. Use software leverage to your advantage.

7. Use shell scripts to increase leverage and portability.

8. Avoid captive user interfaces.

9. Make every program a filter.

### Other mottos

1. Nothing is impossible for a willing heart.

2. Do not reinvent the wheel (reinvent the wheel).

3. Premature optimization is the root of all evil.

4. Follow best practices.

5. Be yourself: everyone else is already taken.

6. This life was not meant to be.

7. Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving.

8. The beautiful attracts the beautiful.

9. You should not defy nature!

10. Look before you leap.

Learning to others and keeping a modest heart, running faster and working harder, I will be better.
